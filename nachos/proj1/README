Project description:

    We used the lecture slides and project writeup as our guideline for PA1.
We found this to be the most useful way to tackle this project. Also reading
the function description is very helpful as well. We tested our code against
the given simple test cases at first, then we tried to implement our own tests
based off the given test cases. We divided the work in half. 2&5 for Yifan since
5 needs 2 to work. 1,3&4 for Chen. We ran into a problem with 5 due to an error
we made in join(). After we fix the problem in join(), 5's problem was resolved.
The most important thing we learned is that to always keep track of what the
current thread actually is.
